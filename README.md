# Data for count-based distributional semantic models (word embeddings) of Ancient Greek

This repository contains the data used in Keersmaekers & Speelman 2023, Applying Distributional Semantic Models to a Historical Corpus of a Highly Inflected Language: the Case of Ancient Greek.

It contains two types of data:
* A dataset containing rankings of the nearest neighbors of a number of target words (data_wordsim.txt). This dataset is also published on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/18758240. See the link on Zenodo and the cited paper for more details.
* Various distributional semantic models (word embeddings) of Ancient Greek (all in the folder Vectors). See the cited paper for more details.
